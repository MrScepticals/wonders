            <h1>Machu Picchu</h1>
            <em>Peru</em>
        </div>
        <p>Machu Picchu is a 15th-century Inca citadel located in the Eastern Cordillera of southern Peru on a
            2,430-meter (7,970 ft) mountain ridge. It is located in the Machupicchu District within Urubamba
            Province above the Sacred Valley, which is 80 kilometers (50 mi) northwest of Cusco. The Urubamba River
            flows past it, cutting through the Cordillera and creating a canyon with a tropical mountain climate.

            For most speakers of English or Spanish, the first 'c' in Picchu is silent. In English, the name is
            pronounced /ˌmɑːtʃuː ˈpiːtʃuː/[6][7] or /ˌmætʃuː ˈpiːktʃuː/,[7][8] in Spanish as [ˈmatʃu ˈpitʃu] or [ˈmatʃu
            ˈpiktʃu],[9] and in Quechua (Machu Pikchu)[10] as [ˈmatʃʊ ˈpɪktʃʊ].

            The Incas, in contrast to the Maya, had no written language, and no European visited the site until the 19th
            century, so far as is known. There are, therefore, no written records of the site while it was in use. The
            names of the buildings, their supposed uses, and their inhabitants are all the product of modern
            archeologists, on the basis of physical evidence, including tombs at the site.

            Most recent archaeologists believe that Machu Picchu was constructed as an estate for the Inca emperor
            Pachacuti (1438–1472). Often referred to as the "Lost City of the Incas", it is the most familiar icon of
            Inca civilization. The Incas built the estate around 1450 but abandoned it a century later, at the time of
            the Spanish conquest. According to the new AMS radiocarbon dating, it was occupied from c. 1420–1532.
            Historical research published in 2022 claims that the site was probably called Huayna Picchu by the Inca, as
            it exists on the smaller peak of the same name.

            Machu Picchu was built in the classical Inca style, with polished dry-stone walls. Its three primary
            structures are the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows. Most of the
            outlying buildings have been reconstructed in order to give visitors a better idea of how they originally
            appeared.By 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu had been restored and restoration continues.

            Machu Picchu was declared a Peruvian Historic Sanctuary in 1981 and a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983.
            In 2007, Machu Picchu was voted one of the New Seven Wonders of the World in a worldwide internet poll.</p>
        <h3>Etymology</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>In the Quechua language, machu means "old" or "old person", while pikchu means either "portion of coca being
            crunched" or "pyramid; pointed, multi-sided solid; cone".Thus the name of the site is sometimes
            interpreted as "old mountain".The site is on a narrow saddle between two mountain peaks: Machu Picchu
            and Huayna Picchu.

            A study published in 2022 in Ñawpa Pacha: Journal of the Institute of Andean Studies suggests that, in the
            Quechua language, the abandoned Inca site was called "Huayna Picchu", after the smaller peak at the site, or
            perhaps, just "Picchu". Huayna means "young" in the Quechua language. The research documents that, starting
            in 1911, with the publications of American historian and explorer Hiram Bingham, the name Machu Picchu
            became associated with the ruins.Evidence of references by native Quechua speakers dating to their
            reports to the Spanish, early maps, and even discussions with Bingham, is cited in the new research into
            historical records regarding an apparently arbitrary selection of the name Bingham associated with the
            site—that differed from the traditional name.The name given to the abandoned settlement by its builders
            has not been determined by researchers.</p>
        <h1>History</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Machu Picchu was believed (by Richard L. Burger, professor of anthropology at Yale University) to have been
            built in the 1450s.[23] However, a 2021 study led by Burger used radiocarbon dating (specifically, AMS) to
            reveal that Machu Picchu may have been occupied from around 1420–1530 AD.[24][25] Construction appears to
            date from two great Inca rulers, Pachacutec Inca Yupanqui (1438–1471) and Túpac Inca Yupanqui
            (1472–1493).[26][27]: xxxvi  There is a consensus among archeologists that Pachacutec ordered the
            construction of the royal estate for his use as a retreat, most likely after a successful military campaign.
            Although Machu Picchu is considered to be a "royal" estate, it would not have been passed down in the line
            of succession. Rather it was used for 80 years before being abandoned, seemingly because of the Spanish
            conquests in other parts of the Inca Empire.[23] It is possible that most of its inhabitants died from
            smallpox introduced by travelers before the Spanish conquistadors arrived in the area.[28]</p>
        <h4>Daily life in Machu Picchu</h4>
        <p>During its use as a royal estate, it is estimated that about 750 people lived there, with most serving as
            support staff (yanaconas, yana)[29][page needed][30] who lived there permanently. Though the estate belonged
            to Pachacutec, religious specialists and temporary specialized workers (mayocs) lived there as well, most
            likely for the ruler's well-being and enjoyment. During the harsher season, staff dropped down to around a
            hundred servants and a few religious specialists focused on maintenance alone.[29][page needed]

            Studies show that, according to their skeletal remains, most people who lived there were immigrants from
            diverse backgrounds. They lacked the chemical markers and osteological markers they would have if they had
            been living there their whole lives. Instead, there was bone damage from various species of water parasites
            indigenous to different areas of Peru. There were also varying osteological stressors and varying chemical
            densities suggesting varying long-term diets characteristic of specific regions that were spaced apart.[31]
            These diets are composed of varying levels of maize, potatoes, grains, legumes, and fish, but the overall
            most recent short-term diet for these people was composed of less fish and more corn. This suggests that
            several of the immigrants were from more coastal areas and moved to Machu Picchu where corn was a larger
            portion of food intake.[30] Most skeletal remains found at the site had lower levels of arthritis and bone
            fractures than those found in most sites of the Inca Empire. Inca individuals who had arthritis and bone
            fractures were typically those who performed heavy physical labor (such as the Mit'a) or served in the Inca
            military.[29][page needed]

            Animals are also suspected to have migrated to Machu Picchu, as there were several bones found that were not
            native to the area. Most animal bones found were from llamas and alpacas. These animals naturally live at
            altitudes of 4,000 meters (13,000 ft) rather than the 2,400 meters (7,900 ft) elevation of Machu Picchu.
            Most likely, these animals were brought in from the Puna region[32] for meat consumption and for their
            pelts. Guinea pigs were also found at the site in special tomb caves, suggesting that they were at least
            used for funerary rituals,[29][page needed] as it was common throughout the Inca Empire to use them for
            sacrifices and meat.[33] Six dogs were also recovered from the site. Due to their placements among the human
            remains, it is believed that they served as companions of the dead.</p>
        <h4>Agriculture</h4>
        <p>Much of the farming done at Machu Picchu was done on its hundreds of man-made terraces. These terraces were a
            work of considerable engineering, built to ensure good drainage and soil fertility while also protecting the
            mountain itself from erosion and landslides. However, the terraces were not perfect, as studies of the land
            show that there were landslides that happened during the construction of Machu Picchu. Still visible are
            places where the terraces were shifted by landslides and then stabilized by the Inca as they continued to
            build around the area.[34] Terraces constructed overlooking Urubamba River and many other springs provided
            fresh water for crop production and served more than 1,000 households.[35]

            It is estimated that the area around the site has received more than 1,800 mm (71 in) of rain per year since
            AD 1450, which was more than needed to support crop growth there. Because of the large amount of rainfall at
            Machu Picchu, it was found that irrigation was not needed for the terraces. The terraces received so much
            rain that they were built by Incan engineers specifically to allow for ample drainage of the extra water.
            Excavation and soil analyses done by Kenneth Wright[36][37][38] in the 1990s showed that the terraces were
            built in layers, with a bottom layer of larger stones covered by loose gravel.[34] On top of the gravel was
            a layer of mixed sand and gravel packed together, with rich topsoil covering all of that. It was shown that
            the topsoil was probably moved from the valley floor to the terraces because it was much better than the
            soil higher up the mountain.[29][page needed]

            However, it has been found that the terrace farming area makes up only about 4.9 ha (12 acres) of land, and
            a study of the soil around the terraces showed that what was grown there was mostly corn and potatoes, which
            was not enough to support the 750+ people living at Machu Picchu. This explains why when studies were done
            on the food that the Inca ate at Machu Picchu, it was found that most of what they ate was imported from the
            surrounding valleys and farther afield.[31]</p>
