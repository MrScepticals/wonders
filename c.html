            <h1>Colosseum</h1>
            <em>Rome,Italy</em>
        </div>
        <p>The Colosseum (/ˌkɒləˈsiːəm/ KOL-ə-SEE-əm; Italian: Colosseo [kolosˈsɛːo]) is an oval amphitheatre in the
            centre of the city of Rome, Italy, just east of the Roman Forum. It is the largest ancient amphitheatre ever
            built, and is still the largest standing amphitheatre in the world today, despite its age. Construction
            began under the emperor Vespasian (r. 69–79 AD) in 72[1] and was completed in 80 AD under his successor and
            heir, Titus (r. 79–81).[2] Further modifications were made during the reign of Domitian (r. 81–96).[3] The
            three emperors that were patrons of the work are known as the Flavian dynasty, and the amphitheatre was
            named the Flavian Amphitheatre (Latin: Amphitheatrum Flavium; Italian: Anfiteatro Flavio [aɱfiteˈaːtro
            ˈflaːvjo]) by later classicists and archaeologists for its association with their family name (Flavius).

            The Colosseum is built of travertine limestone, tuff (volcanic rock), and brick-faced concrete. It could
            hold an estimated 50,000 to 80,000 spectators at various points in its history,[4][5] having an average
            audience of some 65,000;[6] it was used for gladiatorial contests and public spectacles including animal
            hunts, executions, re-enactments of famous battles, and dramas based on Roman mythology, and briefly mock
            sea battles. The building ceased to be used for entertainment in the early medieval era. It was later reused
            for such purposes as housing, workshops, quarters for a religious order, a fortress, a quarry, and a
            Christian shrine.

            Although substantially ruined by earthquakes and stone robbers taking spolia, the Colosseum is still an
            iconic symbol of Imperial Rome and was listed as one of the New 7 Wonders of the World.[7] It is one of
            Rome's most popular tourist attractions and also has links to the Roman Catholic Church, as each Good Friday
            the Pope leads a torchlit "Way of the Cross" procession that starts in the area around the Colosseum.[8] The
            Colosseum is depicted on the Italian version of the five-cent euro coin.</p>
        <h1>Name</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Originally, the building's Latin name was simply the Latin: amphitheatrum, lit. 'amphitheatre'.[9] Though the
            modern name Flavian Amphitheatre (Latin: Amphitheatrum Flavium) is often used, there is no evidence it was
            used in Classical Antiquity.[9] This name refers to the patronage of the Flavian dynasty, during whose
            reigns the building was constructed, but the structure is better known as the Colosseum.[9] In antiquity,
            Romans may have referred to the Colosseum by the unofficial name Amphitheatrum Caesareum (with Caesareum an
            adjective pertaining to the title Caesar), but this name may have been strictly poetic[10][11] as it was not
            exclusive to the Colosseum; Vespasian and Titus, builders of the Colosseum, also constructed a Flavian
            Amphitheatre in Puteoli (modern Pozzuoli).[12]

            The name Colosseum is believed to be derived from a colossal statue of Nero on the model of the Colossus of
            Rhodes.[9][3] The giant bronze sculpture of Nero as a solar deity was moved to its position beside the
            amphitheatre by the emperor Hadrian (r. 117–138).[9] The word colosseum is a neuter Latin noun formed from
            the adjective colosseus, meaning "gigantic" or "colossean".[9] By the year 1000 the Latin name "Colosseum"
            had been coined to refer to the amphitheatre from the nearby "Colossus Solis".[13]

            The spelling was sometimes altered in Medieval Latin: coloseum and coliseum are attested from the 12th and
            14th centuries respectively.[9] In the 12th century, the structure was recorded as the amphitheatrum
            colisei, 'Amphitheatre of the Colossus'.[9] In the High Middle Ages, the Flavian amphitheatre is attested as
            the late 13th-century Old French: colosé, and in Middle French as: colisée by the early 16th century, by
            which time the word could be applied to any amphitheatre.[9] From Middle French: colisée derived the Middle
            English: colisee, in use by the middle of the 15th century and employed by John Capgrave in his Solace of
            Pilgrims, in which he remarked: Middle English: collise eke is a meruelous place … þe moost part of it stant
            at þis day.[14] An English translation by John Bourchier, 2nd Baron Berners, of Antonio de Guevara's
            biography of Marcus Aurelius (r. 161–180) in about 1533 referred to Middle English: this Emperour, beynge
            with the Senate at Collisee ....[14] Similarly, the Italian: colosseo, or coliseo, are attested as referring
            first to the amphitheatre in Rome, and then to any amphitheatre (as Italian: culiseo in 1367).[14][9] By
            1460, an equivalent existed in Catalan: coliseu; by 1495 had appeared the Spanish: coliseo, and by 1548 the
            Portuguese: coliseu.[9]


            Colosseum
            The earliest citation for the name Colosseum in Early Modern English is the 1600 translation, by Philemon
            Holland, of the Urbis Romae topographia of Bartolomeo Marliani, which he used in the preparation of his
            translation of Livy's Augustan era Ab Urbe Condita Libri.[9] The text states: "This Amphitheatre was
            commonly called Colosseum, of Neroes Colossus, which was set up in the porch of Neroes house."[9] Similarly,
            John Evelyn, translating the Middle French name: le Colisée used by the architectural theorist Roland Fréart
            de Chambray, wrote "And 'tis indeed a kind of miracle to see that the Colosseum … and innumerable other
            Structures which seemed to have been built for Eternity, should be at present so ruinous and
            dilapidated".[9]</p>
        <h1>History</h1>
        <hr>
        <h4>Construction, inauguration, and Roman renovations</h4>
        <p>The site chosen was a flat area on the floor of a low valley between the Caelian, Esquiline and Palatine
            Hills, through which a canalised stream ran as well as an artificial lake/marsh.[21] By the 2nd century BC
            the area was densely inhabited. It was devastated by the Great Fire of Rome in 64 AD, following which Nero
            seized much of the area to add to his personal domain. He built the grandiose Domus Aurea on the site, in
            front of which he created an artificial lake surrounded by pavilions, gardens and porticoes. The existing
            Aqua Claudia aqueduct was extended to supply water to the area and the gigantic bronze Colossus of Nero was
            set up nearby at the entrance to the Domus Aurea.[20]


            Cross-section from the Lexikon der gesamten Technik (1904)
            Although the Colossus was preserved, much of the Domus Aurea was torn down. The lake was filled in and the
            land reused as the location for the new Flavian Amphitheatre. Gladiatorial schools and other support
            buildings were constructed nearby within the former grounds of the Domus Aurea. Vespasian's decision to
            build the Colosseum on the site of Nero's lake can be seen as a populist gesture of returning to the people
            an area of the city which Nero had appropriated for his own use. In contrast to many other amphitheatres,
            which were on the outskirts of a city, the Colosseum was constructed in the city centre, in effect, placing
            it both symbolically and precisely at the heart of Rome.

            Construction was funded by the opulent spoils taken from the Jewish Temple after the First Jewish–Roman War
            in 70 AD led to the Siege of Jerusalem. According to a reconstructed inscription found on the site, "the
            emperor Vespasian ordered this new amphitheatre to be erected from his general's share of the booty." It is
            often assumed that Jewish prisoners of war were brought back to Rome and contributed to the massive
            workforce needed for the construction of the amphitheatre, but there is no ancient evidence for that; it
            would, nonetheless, be commensurate with Roman practice to add humiliation to the defeated population.[22]
            Along with this free source of unskilled labor, teams of professional Roman builders, engineers, artists,
            painters and decorators undertook the more specialized tasks necessary for building the Colosseum. The
            Colosseum was constructed with several different materials: wood, limestone, tuff, tiles, cement, and
            mortar.

            Construction of the Colosseum began under the rule of Vespasian[3] in around 70–72 AD (73–75 AD according to
            some sources). The Colosseum had been completed up to the third story by the time of Vespasian's death in
            79. The top level was finished by his son, Titus, in 80,[3] and the inaugural games were held in 80 or 81
            AD.[23] Dio Cassius recounts that over 9,000 wild animals were killed during the inaugural games of the
            amphitheatre. Commemorative coinage was issued celebrating the inauguration.[24] The building was remodelled
            further under Vespasian's younger son, the newly designated Emperor Domitian, who constructed the hypogeum,
            a series of tunnels used to house animals and slaves. He also added a gallery to the top of the Colosseum to
            increase its seating capacity.[25]

            In 217, the Colosseum was badly damaged by a major fire (caused by lightning, according to Dio Cassius[26]),
            which destroyed the wooden upper levels of the amphitheatre's interior. It was not fully repaired until
            about 240 and underwent further repairs in 250 or 252 and again in 320. Honorius banned the practice of
            gladiator fights in 399 and again in 404. Gladiatorial fights are last mentioned around 435.[20] An
            inscription records the restoration of various parts of the Colosseum under Theodosius II and Valentinian
            III (reigned 425–455), possibly to repair damage caused by a major earthquake in 443; more work followed in
            484[27] and 508. The arena continued to be used for contests well into the 6th century. Animal hunts
            continued until at least 523, when Anicius Maximus celebrated his consulship with some venationes,
            criticised by King Theodoric the Great for their high cost.[20]</p>
