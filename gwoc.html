            <h1>Great Wall of China</h1>
            <em>China</em>
        </div>
        <p>The Great Wall of China (traditional Chinese: 萬里長城; simplified Chinese: 万里长城; pinyin: Wànlǐ Chángchéng) is a
            series of fortifications that were built across the historical northern borders of ancient Chinese states
            and Imperial China as protection against various nomadic groups from the Eurasian Steppe. Several walls were
            built from as early as the 7th century BC,[4] with selective stretches later joined together by Qin Shi
            Huang (220–206 BC), the first emperor of China. Little of the Qin wall remains.[5] Later on, many successive
            dynasties built and maintained multiple stretches of border walls. The best-known sections of the wall were
            built by the Ming dynasty (1368–1644).

            Apart from defense, other purposes of the Great Wall have included border controls, allowing the imposition
            of duties on goods transported along the Silk Road, regulation or encouragement of trade and the control of
            immigration and emigration.[6] Furthermore, the defensive characteristics of the Great Wall were enhanced by
            the construction of watchtowers, troop barracks, garrison stations, signaling capabilities through the means
            of smoke or fire, and the fact that the path of the Great Wall also served as a transportation corridor.

            The frontier walls built by different dynasties have multiple courses. Collectively, they stretch from
            Liaodong in the east to Lop Lake in the west, from the present-day Sino–Russian border in the north to Tao
            River (Taohe) in the south; along an arc that roughly delineates the edge of the Mongolian steppe; spanning
            21,196.18 km (13,170.70 mi) in total.[7][3] Today, the defensive system of the Great Wall is generally
            recognized as one of the most impressive architectural feats in history.</p>
        <h1>Names</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>The collection of fortifications known as the Great Wall of China has historically had a number of different
            names in both Chinese and English.

            In Chinese histories, the term "Long Wall(s)" (t 長城, s 长城, Chángchéng) appears in Sima Qian's Records of the
            Grand Historian, where it referred both to the separate great walls built between and north of the Warring
            States and to the more unified construction of the First Emperor.The Chinese character 城, meaning city
            or fortress, is a phono-semantic compound of the "earth" radical 土 and phonetic 成, whose Old Chinese
            pronunciation has been reconstructed as *deŋ.It originally referred to the rampart which surrounded
            traditional Chinese cities and was used by extension for these walls around their respective states; today,
            however, it is much more often the Chinese word for "city".

            The longer Chinese name "Ten-Thousand Mile Long Wall" (t 萬里長城, s 万里长城, Wànlǐ Chángchéng) came from Sima
            Qian's description of it in the Records, though he did not name the walls as such. The AD 493 Book of Song
            quotes the frontier general Tan Daoji referring to "the long wall of 10,000 miles", closer to the modern
            name, but the name rarely features in pre-modern times otherwise.The traditional Chinese mile (里, lǐ)
            was an often irregular distance that was intended to show the length of a standard village and varied with
            terrain but was usually standardized at distances around a third of an English mile (540 m).However,
            this use of "ten-thousand" (wàn) is figurative in a similar manner to the Greek and English myriad and
            simply means "innumerable" or "immeasurable".

            Because of the wall's association with the First Emperor's supposed tyranny, the Chinese dynasties after Qin
            usually avoided referring to their own additions to the wall by the name "Long Wall". Instead, various
            terms were used in medieval records, including "frontier(s)" (塞, Sài), "rampart(s)" (垣, Yuán),
            "barrier(s)" (障, Zhàng), "the outer fortresses" (外堡, Wàibǎo), and "the border wall(s)" (t 邊牆, s 边墙,
            Biānqiáng).[15] Poetic and informal names for the wall included "the Purple Frontier" (紫塞, Zǐsài) and
            "the Earth Dragon" (t 土龍, s 土龙, Tǔlóng).Only during the Qing period did "Long Wall" become the
            catch-all term to refer to the many border walls regardless of their location or dynastic origin, equivalent
            to the English "Great Wall".

            Sections of the wall in south Gobi Desert and Mongolian steppe are sometimes referred to as "Wall of Genghis
            Khan", even though Genghis Khan did not construct any walls or permanent defense lines himself.

            The current English name evolved from accounts of "the Chinese wall" from early modern European
            travelers. By the nineteenth century, "the Great Wall of China" had become standard in English and
            French, although other European languages such as German continue to refer to it as "the Chinese wall".

        <h1>History</h1>
        <hr>
        <h3>Early Walls</h3>
        <p>The Chinese were already familiar with the techniques of wall-building by the time of the Spring and Autumn
            period between the 8th and 5th centuries BC.During this time and the subsequent Warring States period,
            the states of Qin, Wei, Zhao, Qi, Han, Yan, and Zhongshan all constructed extensive fortifications
            to defend their own borders. Built to withstand the attack of small arms such as swords and spears, these
            walls were made mostly of stone or by stamping earth and gravel between board frames.


            The Great Wall of the Han is the longest of all walls, from Mamitu near Yumenguan to Liaodong
            King Zheng of Qin conquered the last of his opponents and unified China as the First Emperor of the Qin
            dynasty ("Qin Shi Huang") in 221 BC. Intending to impose centralized rule and prevent the resurgence of
            feudal lords, he ordered the destruction of the sections of the walls that divided his empire among the
            former states. To position the empire against the Xiongnu people from the north, however, he ordered the
            building of new walls to connect the remaining fortifications along the empire's northern frontier. "Build
            and move on" was a central guiding principle in constructing the wall, implying that the Chinese were not
            erecting a permanently fixed border.

            Transporting the large quantity of materials required for construction was difficult, so builders always
            tried to use local resources. Stones from the mountains were used over mountain ranges, while rammed earth
            was used for construction in the plains. There are no surviving historical records indicating the exact
            length and course of the Qin walls. Most of the ancient walls have eroded away over the centuries, and very
            few sections remain today. The human cost of the construction is unknown, but it has been estimated by some
            authors that hundreds of thousands workers died building the Qin wall. Later, the Han,[27] the Northern
            dynasties and the Sui all repaired, rebuilt, or expanded sections of the Great Wall at great cost to defend
            themselves against northern invaders. The Tang and Song dynasties did not undertake any significant
            effort in the region. Dynasties founded by non-Han ethnic groups also built their border walls: the
            Xianbei-ruled Northern Wei, the Khitan-ruled Liao, Jurchen-led Jin and the Tangut-established Western Xia,
            who ruled vast territories over Northern China throughout centuries, all constructed defensive walls but
            those were located much to the north of the other Great Walls as we know it, within China's autonomous
            region of Inner Mongolia and in modern-day Mongolia itself.</p>
        <h3>Ming era</h3>
        <p>The Great Wall concept was revived again under the Ming in the 14th century, and following the Ming
            army's defeat by the Oirats in the Battle of Tumu. The Ming had failed to gain a clear upper hand over the
            Mongol tribes after successive battles, and the long-drawn conflict was taking a toll on the empire. The
            Ming adopted a new strategy to keep the nomadic tribes out by constructing walls along the northern border
            of China. Acknowledging the Mongol control established in the Ordos Desert, the wall followed the desert's
            southern edge instead of incorporating the bend of the Yellow River.

            Unlike the earlier fortifications, the Ming construction was stronger and more elaborate due to the use of
            bricks and stone instead of rammed earth. Up to 25,000 watchtowers are estimated to have been constructed on
            the wall. As Mongol raids continued periodically over the years, the Ming devoted considerable resources
            to repair and reinforce the walls. Sections near the Ming capital of Beijing were especially strong. Qi
            Jiguang between 1567 and 1570 also repaired and reinforced the wall, faced sections of the ram-earth wall
            with bricks and constructed 1,200 watchtowers from Shanhaiguan Pass to Changping to warn of approaching
            Mongol raiders. During the 1440s–1460s, the Ming also built a so-called "Liaodong Wall". Similar in
            function to the Great Wall (whose extension, in a sense, it was), but more basic in construction, the
            Liaodong Wall enclosed the agricultural heartland of the Liaodong province, protecting it against potential
            incursions by Jurchen-Mongol Oriyanghan from the northwest and the Jianzhou Jurchens from the north. While
            stones and tiles were used in some parts of the Liaodong Wall, most of it was in fact simply an earth dike
            with moats on both sides.

            Towards the end of the Ming, the Great Wall helped defend the empire against the Manchu invasions that began
            around 1600. Even after the loss of all of Liaodong, the Ming army held the heavily fortified Shanhai Pass,
            preventing the Manchus from conquering the Chinese heartland. The Manchus were finally able to cross the
            Great Wall in 1644, after Beijing had already fallen to Li Zicheng's short-lived Shun dynasty. Before this
            time, the Manchus had crossed the Great Wall multiple times to raid, but this time it was for conquest. The
            gates at Shanhai Pass were opened on May 25 by the commanding Ming general, Wu Sangui, who formed an
            alliance with the Manchus, hoping to use the Manchus to expel the rebels from Beijing.[35] The Manchus
            quickly seized Beijing, and eventually defeated both the Shun dynasty and the remaining Ming resistance,
            consolidating the rule of the Qing dynasty over all of China proper.

            Under Qing rule, China's borders extended beyond the walls and Mongolia was annexed into the empire, so
            constructions on the Great Wall were discontinued. On the other hand, the so-called Willow Palisade,
            following a line similar to that of the Ming Liaodong Wall, was constructed by the Qing rulers in Manchuria.
            Its purpose, however, was not defense but rather to prevent Han Chinese migration into Manchuria.</p>
