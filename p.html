            <h1>Petra</h1>
            <em>Jordan</em>
        </div>
        <p>Petra (Arabic: Ÿ±ŸÑŸíÿ®Ÿéÿ™Ÿíÿ±Ÿéÿßÿ°, romanized: Al-BatrƒÅ æ; Ancient Greek: Œ†Œ≠œÑœÅŒ±, "Rock", Nabataean: ê¢õê¢öê¢ìê¢à‚Äé),
            originally known to its inhabitants as Raqmu or Raqƒìm≈ç,is a historic and archaeological city in
            southern Jordan. It is adjacent to the mountain of Jabal Al-Madbah, in a basin surrounded by mountains
            forming the eastern flank of the Arabah valley running from the Dead Sea to the Gulf of Aqaba.The area
            around Petra has been inhabited from as early as 7000 BC,and the Nabataeans might have settled in what
            would become the capital city of their kingdom as early as the 4th century BC.Archaeological work has
            only discovered evidence of Nabataean presence dating back to the second century BC,by which time Petra
            had become their capital. The Nabataeans were nomadic Arabs who invested in Petra's proximity to the
            incense trade routes by establishing it as a major regional trading hub.

            The trading business gained the Nabataeans considerable revenue and Petra became the focus of their wealth.
            The Nabataeans were accustomed to living in the barren deserts, unlike their enemies, and were able to repel
            attacks by taking advantage of the area's mountainous terrain. They were particularly skillful in harvesting
            rainwater, agriculture and stone carving. Petra flourished in the 1st century AD, when its famous Al-Khazneh
            structure ‚Äì believed to be the mausoleum of Nabataean king Aretas IV ‚Äì was constructed, and its population
            peaked at an estimated 20,000 inhabitants.

            Although the Nabataean kingdom became a client state of the Roman Empire in the first century BC, it was
            only in 106 AD that it lost its independence. Petra fell to the Romans, who annexed Nabataea and renamed it
            as Arabia Petraea. Petra's importance declined as sea trade routes emerged, and after an earthquake in
            363 destroyed many structures. In the Byzantine era several Christian churches were built, but the city
            continued to decline, and by the early Islamic era it was abandoned except for a handful of nomads. It
            remained unknown until it was rediscovered in 1812 by Johann Ludwig Burckhardt.

            Access to the city is through a 1.2-kilometre-long (3‚ÅÑ4 mi) gorge called the Siq, which leads directly to
            the Khazneh. Famous for its rock-cut architecture and water conduit system, Petra is also called the "Rose
            City" because of the colour of the stone from which it is carved.It has been a UNESCO World Heritage
            Site since 1985. UNESCO has described Petra as "one of the most precious cultural properties of man's
            cultural heritage".In 2007, Al-Khazneh was voted one of the New 7 Wonders of the World. Petra is a
            symbol of Jordan, as well as Jordan's most-visited tourist attraction. Tourist numbers peaked at 1.1 million
            in 2019, marking the first time that the figure rose above the 1 million mark. Tourism in the city was
            crippled by the COVID-19 pandemic, but soon after started to pick up again, reaching 260,000 visitors in
            2021.</p>
        <h3>Importance in antiquity</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>Pliny the Elder and other writers identify Petra as the capital of the Nabataean Kingdom and the centre of
            their caravan trade. Enclosed by towering rocks and watered by a perennial stream, Petra not only possessed
            the advantages of a fortress, but controlled the main commercial routes which passed through it to Gaza in
            the west, to Bosra and Damascus in the north, to Aqaba and Leuce Come on the Red Sea, and across the desert
            to the Persian Gulf.</p>
        <h1>History</h1>
        <hr>
        <h4>Neolithic</h4>
        <p>By 7000 BC, some of the earliest recorded farmers had settled in Beidha, a Pre-Pottery Neolithic settlement
            just north of Petra.</p>
        <h4>Bronze Age</h4>
        <p>Petra is listed in Egyptian campaign accounts and the Amarna letters as Pel, Sela or Seir</p>
        <h4>Iron Age Edom</h4>
        <p>The Iron Age lasted between 1200 and 600 BC, in that time, the Petra area was occupied by the Edomites. This
            came when the Edomites rebelled after the death of King Solomon in 928 BC when Israel split into two
            kingdoms for Israel to be in the north and Judah in the south. The Edomites were known as descendents of
            Esau and this was referenced in the Old Testament of the Bible. The configuration of mountains in Petra
            allowed for a reservoir of water for the Edomites. This made Petra a stopping ground for Merchants, making
            it an outstanding area for trade. Things that were traded here included wines, olive oil and wood.

            Initially, the Edomites were accompanied by Nomads who eventually left, but the Edomites stayed and made
            their mark on Petra before the emergence of the Nabataens. They were then engaged in battle with King
            Amaziah of Judah and chased back into their own lands. It is said that 10,000 men were thrown off of the
            mountain Umm el-Biyara. This story has been debated by scholars.

            The Edomite site excavated at the top of the Umm el-Biyara mountain at Petra was established no earlier than
            the seventh century BC (Iron II)</p>
        <h4>The emergence of Petra</h4>
        <p>The Nabataeans were one among several nomadic Bedouin tribes that roamed the Arabian Desert and moved with
            their herds to wherever they could find pasture and water.Although the Nabataeans were initially
            embedded in Aramaic culture, theories about them having Aramean roots are rejected by many modern scholars.
            Instead, archaeological, religious and linguistic evidence confirm that they are a northern Arabian
            tribe.Current evidence suggests that the Nabataean name for Petra was Raqƒìm≈ç, variously spelled in
            inscriptions as rqmw or rqm.</p>
